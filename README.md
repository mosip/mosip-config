# MOSIP Configuration

## Overview

The **mosip-config** repository is the central configuration repository for the MOSIP platform.
It contains the configuration files required for various MOSIP modules.

This repository works in conjunction with the **Spring Cloud Config Server**, enabling MOSIP services to fetch their configuration dynamically at runtime without requiring application rebuilds.

For setup and startup instructions for config server, refer to the  [MOSIP Config Server Setup Guide](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-processor/registration-processor-developers-guide#environment-setup).
